# etcsecure
Ethereum Classic Security project, Django app base.

Django with Python 2.7 was selected because of intended integration with other tools using Python 2.7. This repository is for the website, and not any of our tools. If submitted security patches aren't integrated into other repositories, we will fork and link from here.

Website published on github to accelerate integration and for external auditing. We will publish the ETC wallet for security reward donations, and a separate wallet for developing tools, educational materials, performing audits and submitting bugfixes. The security fund will be exclusively for rewards given to researchers for submitting bugs and patches. The administration of the security fund is still under discussion.
